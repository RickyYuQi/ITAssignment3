								<h3 class="gurei">Felix Langham</h3>
								<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
								<p class="gurei">My name is Felix Langham, I graduated in 2018, my student number is 3885080, and my team name is ‘Spurs’.
									I was born in Australia but my whole family is English.
									My favourite hobbies include snowboarding and Djing and going to the gym.
									My experience with IT includes self-taught SSH, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
									Additionally, I built myself a gaming PC and have hacked x-box’s and administrator controls on laptops.
									I enjoy tackling the many challenges that arise in coding, the puzzles to solve so that my python code runs properly or figuring out the correct CSS so that my website does what I want it to do.
									Furthermore,
									I am interested in learning how to program as it is a highly employable skill and can be applied to a wide variety of fields.
								</p>
								<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
								<p class="gurei">Over the course of the project the group stayed in constant communication and was able to complete assignment 2 with a standard of work.
									Our mistakes from assignment 1 were used as teaching tools to inform us of our weaknesses and focus on these areas to improve upon in order to complete the assignment effectively.
									The group worked well together with no arguments or great disagreements which resolved in a smooth workflow.
								</p>
								<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
								<p class="gurei">My ideal job is one that is remote, is in programming or development and preferably high paying.
									The position I have found includes front end development work, likely web development, specifically using React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. For this position it is required that you have 6+ years of development experience,
									and are highly proficient in React, TypeScript and JavaScript.
									Currently, I have less than 1 years of development experience and am only slightly proficient in JavaScript. In addition, the job listing states that it is preferable to have some experience in .NET, Cloud, and eCommerce.
									All of which I have no experience in. In order to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for this job I am going to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT.
									Supplementing this with personal projects and freelance work building up my experience whilst creating a portfolio using the aforementioned stack.
									Some examples of extracurricular activities I might undertake would be: creating apps, websites and doing online courses such as CS50. <br><br>
								In contrast with other members of my group my current career path differentiates in the sense that I am keen on working remote and in the field of front end web development however,
								there are some similarities with other group members in the way that they acquire skills through extra-curricular activities such as and building a personal portfolio of work as well as undergoing a bachelors of IT in order to gain the necessary qualifications for future employment.

							<h3 class="gurei">Ricky Yu Qi Yao</h3>
							<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
							<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Ricky Yu Qi (Ricky) Yao, I graduated from East Doncaster Secondary College in 2020 and am now a first-year university student undergoing study for the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University,
								my student number being s3896813. I am an Australian born 07/02/2003 in Melbourne, Victoria coming from an Asian (Chinese) background.
								I enjoy playing video games and listening to music, it was the interest in both which led to my prominent usage of the internet and my laptop which increased my bond and affinity towards electronic devices.
								I am interested in the field of IT technologies due to its increasing growth and stability in the job market, providing a stable transition from student to employee in the future.
								Up until my studies at RMIT university, I had not before delved into the world of IT that much in terms of coding and network, but I am eager to learn. For assignment two, I will be working together within the team ’Spurs’.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								Assignment 2 overall, I believe was completed in an organised and timely manner.
								All independent team members were able to complete their distributed components with ease, quickly and effectively under our timed constraints.
								Some minor errors occurred during the initial preparation, organisation and distribution of the workloads and possibly the lack of communication between the group.
								However despite these issues, we were ultimately able to complete the assignment to an acceptable degree.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								After my studies at RMIT, I plan to pursue a profession within the field of network engineering.
								Such skills required of a network engineer are knowledge of network domain and infrastructure, with abilities capable of diagnosing and troubleshooting errors within a network system, and skills in integrating network protocols and restraints.
								Qualifications and job skills required for this career are most similar to my teammate Thorpe Honeyman, this is as we are pursuing a similar career pathway exploring the field of networking.
								I believe that during my time spent at RMIT, I will acquire the adequate knowledge and capabilities within the field of networking and be able to pursue a career as a network engineer in the possible future. In the event that I would like to pursue a higher education in order to assume a higher position,
								I may return to RMIT to gain a masters to gain additional knowledge within my field.

							<h3 class="gurei">Michael Lim </h3>
							<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
							<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Michael Lim, my student code is s3543066 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I am an Australian born Chinese, and a Fourth year university student studying a Bachelor of Mechanical engineering at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology.
								I am fluent in English, and have basic knowledge of speaking mandarin and Japanese. My interests include all forms of pop culture, technology, weightlifting, and socialising.
								My interest in Information Technology started with playing video games, which I have played since primary school.
								During high school, I was able to take IT as an elective.
								I learnt the basics of programming, and made simple applications and games.
								I learnt that coding and designing programs was a fun creative output.
								My studies at RMIT have taught me many concepts in the field of engineering and how they applied to real world situations.
								I hope to continue my studies and graduate from RMIT.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								I believe for assignment 2 the group worked relatively well together, the group’s worth ethic was good, and each member properly and efficiently did their designated tasks.
								Work was properly delegated relatively evenly and was done prior to the due date with time to properly refine it and rectify any errors.
								For assignment 3, with some of the key areas of its documentation being the timeframe section and plan and progress section, a push to better the groups time management is put into place.
								This is intended to help the group better themselves, and give more time to allow refinement with our writing ability and work on the artifacts of the assignment.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								My current career path is to aim to be a mechanical engineer, preferably in the field of parts and materials design.
								The main programs of trade which I have learnt in my time at RMIT are AutoCad, Solid works and CATIA, these are engineering design programs that allow a user to design drawings and 3 dimensional models and can perform a digital stimulation of possible loads via a finite element analysis.
								As I am the only one of the projects following the field of engineering, my career path is quite different to my peers in which they are all following the field of IT.
								However, the field of design of technology is something which quite a few of the members of the group are following, alas be it the software design in comparison to hardware or materials design in my case.
								Upon graduation, I plan to get an internship at a mid to large size engineering firm or gain an entry level job such as engineering draftsman for experience for the time being. The intent to travel to another country to seek work has always been a thought process which I have had.
								My current huddles are graduating university, having experience and being financially capable of putting the plan into action.<br><br>
								Overall, my career path is quite like the rest of my groups, graduate university, find an entry level job or internship, then extend my career path henceforth.
								The area of study may be different but the path and how I intend to travel down it is relatively the same as the team's approach.

							<h3 class="gurei">Collin Ng</h3>
							<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
							<p class="gurei">Hi! My name is Collin Ng (s3901105 - part of the SPURS group) and I’m in my first year of Bachelor of IT.
								I was born in Malaysia and when I was 4 years old my family migrated to Melbourne, which is where we’ve been living ever since.
								I graduated from Highvale Secondary College in 2020.
								I grew up in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne so my family and I are pretty westernised, and my siblings and I can only speak English, but we do still celebrate Asian cultural events like Chinese New Year.<br>
							<br>I’m super into basketball, skateboarding, playing video games (valorant got me cramming this assignment), working out in my backyard, and since Uni started, I’ve been really enjoying meeting new people and experiencing the Uni life.
							Recently I got my Ls, so I’ve been really getting into driving cars and car designs, especially the street car culture (JDM cars are so nice to look at).
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								Team spurs worked exceptionally well throughout our work on assignment 2.
								We demonstrated excellent teamwork, communication and delegation skills which resulted in us completing assignment 2 in time for the due date and to the best of our abilities.
								Our group had gotten comfortable since the first assignment and because of this we were able to work efficiently and effectively.
								We will carry over these same processes into this assignment.
								We are most comfortable with these methods and perform really well.
								In the future we may alter these processes slightly as we have to cater to new tasks and objectives that come up,
								for example when we start to develop our mobile application our process will change slightly to accommodate this task.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								As of right now I see my dream career in cybersecurity. This field of IT revolves around the necessity of protecting a company’s networks, systems, as well as the personal data of both employees and customers.
								This requires me to keep up with the up-and-coming technological advancements in order to survey how these advancements can be used by potential hackers or maybe even utilised to protect a company from threats.
								Through this understanding cybersecurity specialists will be in charge of implementing threat protection measures and security controls.
								I will not be able to become a cybersecurity specialist straight out of highschool, as this position requires years of experience and knowledge.
								So for the meanwhile taking up a lower level position within cybersecurity is necessary to gain this knowledge and experience.<br><br>
								Compared to the other members in my group, I share a pretty similar career pathway.
								This consists of completing studies at university, taking up a job related to their dream job in order to obtain experience, and then finally achieving the position of that dream job.
								For me though, I still have very little experience and knowledge about other fields in IT, so I think there is a good possibility my dream career will change.

							<h3 class="gurei">Domenic Sinni</h3>
							<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
							<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Domenic Sinni (s3900567 - part of the SPURS group) and I was born and raised in Melbourne and I am a first-year student after graduating from high school.
								I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology and I chose to complete my studies at RMIT for multiple reasons but mainly because of its reputation of being an excellent technology-based university and the location.
								I enjoy gaming, especially games like Call of Duty, NBA2K, Pokemon, Fortnite and Terraria.
								I also have a great passion for basketball and the NBA.
								I enjoy programming and while I only know the basics, I am trying to learn more and improve my skills in programming as I wish to be a programmer for my career.
								I have no real experience in the IT field, and so this course is going to help me get started in the field as I do wish to go further in this field.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								I personally believe that the group worked well together during Assessment 2,
								as while there were improvements that could be made to improve the work of the assessment, the group managed to get together and focus and get the work completed in a timely and efficient manner.
								The first few weeks of Assessment 2 were a slight struggle, as not much work was completed during this period of time, however after this minor error, the organisation and work rate improved significantly as well as the communication across the group.
								The group was able to complete the assignment on time and to an acceptable standard.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								I would like to work as a video game programmer and/or developer.
								The main abilities and qualities that are required for this kind of role would include communication, teamwork, problem solving, passion and creativity, and time management.
								The IT related skills that are required for this job would include knowledge of game engine such as Unity, knowledge of coding and programming languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS, as well as experience in making small projects like a mobile game.
								To be able to apply for this type of job, the qualifications that I need in order to pursue this course would include experience using game engines, at least 1-2 personal game projects on PC/Mobile, as well as a tertiary degree or an equivalent professional qualification in a relevant field.
								While I complete my university degree, I plan on creating my own little projects to gain more experience in the field that I wish to pursue, and after I have graduated I plan on applying for a job that is based around game programming or applying for an internship.<br><br>
								My career plan is not that dissimilar from the rest of the group, in the sense that each of us plan to complete a degree in a relevant field in order to be eligible for their respective career. My job is different from most of the group, except it does have some similarities to Tomoki’s plan, as it involves improving programming skills.
								Game programming is a far different career from a career like Network Engineering for example, and so my plan is different from Ricky and Thorpe’s career plans.

							<h3 class="gurei">Sakamoto Tomoki</h3>
							<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
							<p class="gurei">Hello. My name is Sakamoto Tomoki, my student code is s3821551 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS.
								I graduated from the National Institute of Technology, Kagoshima College in Japan after studying electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years.
								I was shocked by the high level of graduate students other than myself at the internship I did when I was in the 4th grade, and decided to go abroad (internship students other than myself are graduate students).
								I used to have a dog when I was in Japan, but since I came to Australia I have had four cats. And also mate cats and sell kittens.
								So far, I figured out buyers for kittens and sold 11 kittens.<br>
							<br>
							After studying as one of the college classes, my interest in IT began.
							The site I created after graduating from college gets over 300,000 PV every month and is profitable by affiliates and Google Adsense.
							For example, in an article I wrote about Nintendo Switch's new game "Monster Hunter" last month, it was accessed by nearly 5,000 people every day. Therefore, last month's sales $ 10,000 on Amazon.
							it's only the controller.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								In assignment 2, the work did not proceed easily during the first few weeks because we did not know each other very much, however after Micky managed to organise the team well, our group cooperated and efficiently shared the work.
								In assignment 3, we will make use of our previous reflections to try to communicate with each other and take care not to delay the work.
								In addition, unlike the last time, the roles are divided by making the best use of each other's areas of expertise, so we are functioning well toward achieving the tasks.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								I am planning to work as a software engineer in the future.
								After graduating from RMIT, I will return to Japan and work, but I would like to get a job at an overseas company that has expanded into Japan in recent years.
								Therefore, I would like to get some experience working together with people of different nationalities during my study abroad period. This Assessment is also very interesting to me.
								Working together as a team to perform a single task is very similar to a real working environment. I had experience enrolled in a Japanese university, but they did not have this kind of assignment.
								And improving my programming skills, I believe the RMIT uni has an environment to hone my coding skill.
								The field of machine learning using Python, which I am currently studying in other courses, is a field that has been delayed in development in Japan, so I think it will definitely be useful when I return to Japan.
								In addition, I am developing a smartphone app using Flutter for myself.
								I plan on releasing it in August, and I think this process will probably be useful for my career.
								Based on group work in these English environments, machine learning with Python, and individual development experience, when I go back to Japan, I want to succeed with my job.<br><br>
								My group members seem to be planning to get a job in Australia, so my career plan is very different from other group members, but I think it's similar to Domenic in improving programming skills.

							<h3 class="gurei">Thorpe Honeyman</h3>
							<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
							<p class="gurei">I am Thorpe Honeyman, student number s3897395, of team SPURS.
								I am a first year student at RMIT, studying a Bachelor of Information Technology.
								I was born to an english family in Crewe, England, and lived near there until I was four and a half,
								when I moved to Australia. I have previously studied IT as a VET course at Ringwood Training, during high school at Mullauna College.
								In my free time I attend scouting groups, both as a rover, and as a trainee cubs leader. For cubs I attend weekly meetings where I help teach the cubs camping skills and run games.
								I also sometimes attend cubs camps where I help lead groups of cubs to activities, and ensure that they stay safe.
								When I’m not scouting I am usually playing video games, mainly roguelikes such as Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac.
								I have been interested in IT since my high school allowed me to do it as an elective, and I have had a continual interest, mainly in building computers and linking them into networks.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								The group worked well together for assignment 2, although there were quite a few improvements that could have been made.
								The initial few weeks for assignment 2 were mostly unused, and it took some time before the group really got into the motion of the project.
								Another difficulty was that the group wasn’t very good at communicating with each other, both in the work they had done, and their future availability.
								To fix these issues, we will aim to talk more consistently, and start the project at an earlier date.
							</p>
							<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								I intend upon becoming a network administrator, or possibly network engineer, after completing this Bachelor of Information Technology.
								To achieve this I will require a Bachelor level degree in IT, which is very achievable as that is what I am already studying.
								I Would benefit from further study into networking, like the Certificate III in Networking that I have achieved.
								My career requires very common work skills, such as time-management, team-working and problem-solving, but also requires skills unique to networking.
								These skills include an understanding of network parts, wiring types and troubleshooting techniques.
								For a higher level job as network administrator, it would be important that I have at least some level of experience within a networking or general IT environment, so working as a technical support initially could help that be achieved. <br>
								Within the group, my career is most similar to Ricky Yu Qi Yao’s, as we are both interested in pursuing networking.
								My career is also similar to the remainder of the group, as we are all, apart from Michael, interested in IT.

					<h3>Github reflection</h3>
					<p>To document data and project progression, we utilised Google documents as the predominant storage of information collected by the group.
						Regrettably, as the website of the project was not seen as the main priority, it was not finalised or worked on much until the end of the project.
						Thus, the Github repository with its records of modifications are quite little, or even untouched by some of the members of the group.
						With this in mind, the group's mindset is that the Github repository does not fully represent the group's work ethic or time used on this project.
						Looking at the modification history of the google documents or watching the meeting recordings is a much more valuable record of our work ethic. </p>

						<h2 class="gurei">Project Description</h2>
						<h3 class="gurei">Hoop Stats™ Application</h3>
						<h3 class="gurei">Overview</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							A user friendly application which tallies official basketball statistics such as, match points and total points of players and teams.
							This will be done via a smart camera sensor monitoring the specific player, their score, and whenever they make any shot.
							An additional function of this application would be aiding the player in a training aspect, directing them on the angle of shots, ideal form, their technique of their jump, etc.
						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Topic</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							Team Spurs strives towards the production of a recreational basketball application, providing a new and innovative design to the existing market.
							Catering towards an audience of both casual and avid basketball players, our program will offer real-time performance statistics for both individual and team players in addition to a multitude of other features such as training drills,
							and online platform where individuals can interact and post their highlights. By providing a social medium specifically for basketball enthusiasts,
							it allows for users with like-interests to converge and become friends in addition to providing a specified outlet for users to share their highlights.
						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Motivation</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							Heading into this project, the idea derived from Collin’s love for basketball and his desire to merge both interest in technology and basketball together to create an application which can accurately track match performance and record highlights to share with friends and family.
							<br><br>
							The importance of this project is its compilation of the simple concept of highlighting basketball though social media, which would be giving the targeted audience a hub to distribute their achievements.
							 <br><br>
							 All whilst, integrating in depth concepts of technology usage, showcased via simple basketball drills.
							 This would in turn allow the gathering of statistics and data, would aid in the development in sport science in the field of basketball or whatever sport it is implemented to.
							 <br><br>
							 With the coming of the digital age of augmented reality (AR), smart devices and the ever-advancing platform of social media, the project incorporates some of the most recently developed technologies in each of these fields.
							 Be it the use of IoT smart devices to connect the desired system and return feedback data to aid in our research, or the use of Artificial Intelligence learning to differentiate objects and track poses to collect more data towards our research.
							 <br><br>
							 This project can be seen as quite profitable in the right hands to possible future employers.
							 It showcases a diverse range of technologies, which in turn can be seen as useful to multiple different parties, thus if one field does not interest the target another might.
							 In addition, when going into depth in any of the areas of research, each individual field has mountains of possibilities, even the proper resources.

						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Landscape</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							Basketball has been a relevant topic within the media for many decades, with many dedicated fan bases leading to it’s prosperity in the field of sports.
							As a result, many different technologies and applications have been developed in order to take advantage of its rapid growth, using this opportunity to break into the market.
							<br><br>
							In relation to the sport, an application known as ‘HomeCourt’ can be identified as a major competitor for our project as it contains many of our leading features.
							These functionalities include that of training drills, and performance tracking.
							It utilised cameras to track and record a users movements to gauge performance, in return providing them with statistics and guided feedback on their gameplay.
							<br><br>
							Additionally, technologies have also been developed to trace player performance and progress though equipable accessories such as wristbands and smartwatches.
							Major leading tech companies like HUAWEI have designed the ‘Band 4e’, containing capabilities in collecting “precise basketball or running performance statistics”.
							<br><br>
							Furthermore, there have been major advancements in machine learning algorithms with programs such as ‘AutoSTATS’ which learn algorithms to train a camera to detect and actively track players.
							Such code can be applied to different types of sensors to aid in data collection of players and the ball, accurately identifying when a goal is made, or a penalty scenario is committed.
							<br><br>
							Following the development of the HoopStats™ project, Team Spurs is required to actively note these applications and processes as they yield similar approaches in terms of a basketball application.
							As a result, their design must be transformative to the extent where it does not breach any copyright guidelines.
							<br><br>
							Within our application, we aim to integrate a social media aspect into our system.
							Differing from typical social mediums, this one which is modified for the app will be targeted specifically for the basketball devoted followers.
							This allows like-minded users with an interest in the field of basketball to have a convenient platform by which they can use to communicate.
							Like other social media platforms, users will be able to post highlights from their games and performance statistics gathered using the application and its related processes.

<!-- Detailed Description-->
				<section id="detailed" class="wrapper style3 fullscreen fade-up">
					<div class="inner">
						<h2 class="gurei">Detailed Description</h2>
						<h3 class="gurei">Aims</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							HoopStats™’s overarching goal is the growth of basketball.
							This comes in many forms, from improving interconnectivity, to increasing the popularity of the sport, and even improving the overall skill of basketball players.
							<br><br>
							With the creation of HoopStats™ , we intend to accomplish all these different parts of basketball's growth using different features.
							First and foremost, the tracking aspect of the application is implemented to gather accurate data on the users.
							This data is intended for both the purpose of allowing users to compare themselves to each other, and gauge their own skills,
							but to also see what attributes of basketball they are least proficient at, so that they know how to train in order to improve their skills.
							<br><br>
							The tracking of the user’s blood rate and calorie burning is intended for the purpose of allowing the user to understand more about how they are affected by each game and by different training exercises.
							The database linked to the applications aims to store data from all users together, to allow easier comparison of different users’ data.
							<br><br>
							The final major feature of HoopStats™ that has a particular aim is the media feature.
							While the world is already full of social media platforms, we intend for our app to assist in linking basketball players, allowing for larger networks within the same sport.
							The app also intends to encourage users to spend less time on different social media platforms, and instead to be active, and possibly seek to meet their online friends over a game of basketball.
						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Plans and Progress</h3>
						<h4 class="gurei">Live performance tracking p.1 – IoT Wristband</h4>
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="images/iotsens.png">
							<br>
						<p class="gurei">
							One of the key factors of the design of this project is the implementation of live performance tracking of the user with their skills in basketball.
							This would be split between two technologies; one would be the development of an Internet of Technology (IoT) smart device, that would differentiate between players on field and give feedback data to indicate areas of improvement.
							The other technology that would be required to develop would be Artificial intelligence (AI) learning to have a camera differentiate between objects, calculate trajectory of the ball’s movement, and pose tracking of the user.
							<br><br>
							The IoT device is designed to have various functions that all culminate to aid in the completion of the key function of live performance tracking.
							In particular, the device is to be desired to be designed in the way of a band or chip embedded inside a wristband to be within the accessory restrictions of the official NBA rulings.
							The IoT device is designed to have three key functions; the first would be its original function as a IoT device, it would be a means of connection from itself to the connected smart device, this would be done via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
							The second function would be as an identification tracker, an ID number will be generated upon the user’s creation of their account of HoopStats™.
							This is intended to help pinpoint the user within the camera frame. Whilst also is intended for it to be able to differentiate between different IoT devices, given the situation of if two or more IoT devices are worn and in the cameras’ frame at the same time.
							This function is intended for the use of multi-user training drills or to differentiate and pinpoint a player between the nine other players whilst in a match.
							The third and final key function is for the IoT wrist band to be a health band, one which would receive data from its user and send it to the HoopStats™ database, this data could also be reviewed by the user on their own personal page in the HoopStats™ application.
							This is intended to help the teams research into the user and to help indicate which areas that would be most beneficial to help the user to improve their gameplay. The type of data the wristband is intended to receive from the user, would be their stress levels, blood pressure, heart rate, the calories burnt etc.
							<br><br>
							Regrettably, the development of the technology of an IoT smart device is still only at the initial stage of research, the group underestimated the task of designing and developing a IoT smart device on our own.
							Especially once the group started to research the development of the IoT device, we realised it needed more functions to fit the ideal design of the project.
							With discussion between the group members, it was decided the key functions of the IoT device would be, for the device to have connection via a choice of wavelengths, Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, an ID number tracker and for it to have a means to differentiate it from another IoT band.
							Lastly, for it to have the functions of a health band. Scheduling wise, the group is a bit behind schedule, it was predicted that the group could start development of the IoT device, at least the initial function’s part within the first four weeks of this assignment.
							However, due to poor time management, personal reasons, and unexpected events the group's progress has been stunted. Given the situation, time and funding has become the hardest resources to manage to the success of this project.
							<br><br>
							The group’s goal is the design and development of an application which could be a social media hub for the targeted audience of fans of basketball, whilst also implementing technology that would aid in the growth of the performance of its users.
							As the group has reached its final week of available time to be able to work on this project, the group is sadly halted from further progress into this project.
							As such, the group has outlined a few key points of area of research and scheduling for a further ten weeks of research and development, namely noted in this document.
							Given the additional time of ten weeks, the group believes it can complete the desired goal of completing the development of the HoopStats™ application and required technologies.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Live performance tracking p.2 – Artificial Intelligence Learning</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							One of the key factors of the design of this project is the implementation of live performance tracking of the user with their skills in basketball.
							The most crucial technology that would be required to do this would be Artificial intelligence (AI) learning or Machine learning.
							To have a camera differentiate between objects, calculate trajectory of the ball’s movement, and track the movement of the user via their pose movement.
							<br><br>
							The design and development of AI learning is the backbone of the live performance tracking idea.
							The concept of being able to track and obtain data from a person literally just from viewing them though a camera, resulted in one of the key ideas of the project being to aid in the growth of basketball skill.
							This also followed on of the initial core concepts of the project, being able to highlight specific achievements of a user whilst they play basketball.
							Having the camera automatically track the user would allow an easier time to pinpoint possible high-level plays of the user.
							<br><br>
							The concept of live tracking a person’s performance in real time, and how this would be beneficial to improving it, is as follows.
							Recording footage from a person’s gameplay can give very crucial information, it could show in the case of basketball, the angle of the shot and speed of which the ball is travelling.
							With these two pieces of information, it is not too hard to calculate the trajectory of the ball’s travel.
							Using trigonometry and calculations on the force applied to the ball from the given speed of the shot, it can be predicted whether an attempted shot would be successful or not.
							This information could then be recorded and replayed to the user.
							It could show what the user could have done to fix a failed attempt at the shot, be it applied more force or changing the angle of shot by altering their hand positions or their posture.
							<br><br>
							Whilst in the frame of a smart device camera within the HoopStats™ application installed onto it, the AI learning functions of the application are designed to track the users’ performance, analyse it, and provide feedback to the user.
							With use from a smart device camera to film the user and having the machine learning framework be used for tracking the user and analysis of their performance.
							<br><br>
							The development of the function of Machine learning AI, is still somewhat past its initial stage.
							The core concept has been completed, but the actual development has not properly begun. All the key functions of the live performance tracking would be done by the machine learning framework.
							It would track the movement of the user, differentiate between the user and their surroundings, and do calculations for the trajectory of the ball’s movement.
							<br><br>
							It has been decided the group will use the machine learning framework of "ML kit "on Android and "Core ML" on iOS since our app is considering deploying services on both Android and iOS.
							This allows object detection and tracking.
							In the actual application, image analysis is performed by machine learning, and the trajectory of the shot is tracked, the number of shot times and successes, and the shot position on the court is updated in real-time.
							<br><br>
							To make these successful, do the following:
							1) Lowering the recent years of high-performance camera frames and high resolution. Since it is a possibility that the smartphone will be overloaded with more data than necessary for tracking, reduce the amount of video data to be acquired.
							2) Ask the user to align the hoop position and court to be in the camera's frame before playing to measure the exact position of the player's shot.
							3) Track players, basketball, and goals, and exclude the others visual data.
							<br><br>
							Overall, the tracked data by the smart device will be analysed by A.I. and the results can be displayed to the player in real-time.
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="sho_track.png">
							<br><br>
							Future development stage, if the group were given more time, finalization of the development of this technology could be put into place. With it the core of the project would be finished and the completion of the key function of the application would be done.

						<h4 class="gurei">Data storage</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								Efficient and effective data storage is one of the most pursued aspects of any business in today’s society, not just in the technology field.
								Every business must be able to store their data in an efficient and secure way, so that it can not be accessed by anyone who wishes to access it, and so that it can be tracked to make important decisions in the future.
								When it comes to data storage, the majority of businesses and other personnel would consider applying a database to store their data.
								The main purpose of databases is to store information and data of multiple types, including text, images, media files, integers and more. Databases allow businesses to safely and securely store their data and information for the whole business,
								while only giving access to those who are allowed to access the data. Some of the main advantages of databases include reduced data redundancy, increased consistency, an improvement to data integrity, and improved data security.
								<br><br>
								Another popular option when it comes to storing data is cloud storage. Cloud storage involves storing data and information onto the cloud, from which can be accessed at any time and location by authorised users.
								Cloud storage is not recommended to be the main source of data storage for any business, but applying cloud storage has multiple advantages, such as ease of access, usability, cost efficiency, and multiple user capacity.
								<br><br>
								Due to our application’s reliance on personal information, both with the social media side and personal growth side, data and data storage are beyond important for our plan of action to function.
								Currently we have planned that within the period of weeks 10 through week 12, we will have implemented and tested the SQL database that will be capable of storing all information that the application requires.
								This database will store data on basketball teams, players and their statistics, and be capable of linking players to their appropriate teams, and statistics to the appropriate player.
								It is planned that, within the three week timeframe, the database won’t be connected to the application.
							</p>
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="images/SQL_1.png">
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="images/SQL_2.png">
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="images/SQL_3.png">
							<br>
							<p class="gurei">
								In future stages of the application’s development, it is planned that the working database will be linked to the existing parts of the application.
								This process will be done through the use of an API, or Application Programming interface. APIs are programs that act as a link or bridge between two different applications.
								In this case, an API would be used to link the data that is displayed and recorded by the end user’s phone to the database, which would be stored in a server.
								This setup will be optimal, as it means that the end user’s device needs less available storage, and allows all users to reference the data from the same copy of the database.
							</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Social Media feed</h4>
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="images/fig1.png">
							<img class="picsha shadoww" src="images/fig2.png">
							<br>
							<p class="gurei">Within our current age and society, individuals have formed a tight attachment towards various forms of media to inform themselves of events around the globe, with at least 3.7 billion individuals being connected as of 2019.
								As the years have progressed, recreational media has taken highlight as they have appealed towards the larger, younger audience. By introducing a basketball centric social media platform for individuals will broaden the horizon for our demographic and the overall reach of our application.
								<br><br>
								Online currently, there exists many platforms of social media and forum platforms with the major competitors within the market being that of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit. The issue with the leading platforms includes the fact that relevant topics are various,
								leading towards the influx of data from various outlets which often lead the user astray and disoriented.
								It is cited that as of June 2018, 400 million active daily users spent an average of 53 minutes per day on the platform. Team Spurs believes that we can reduce screen time of users and encourage users to become more active in their day to day lives.
								We desire to pursue this through the redesigned format of popular social media forums, maintaining only exclusively basketball related content and features signature to the application.
								<br><br>
								Differing from typical media, users will be able to use, manipulate and post their data collected from the application and post them online to share with their selected audiences.
								Gathered data from the application can include that of basketball performance, e.g., career shots landed, time spent with the ball and/or rebounds made.
								<br><br>
								The interface for our desired social media application will be produced utilising figma prototype production, using wireframes to connect and present the appearance and desired functionality of our application.
								<br><br>
								Data storage will be ideally run on existing cloud computing servers, such that of ‘Google Cloud’ to store our services data.
								This service is preferable in this project as it is available and accessible to major worldwide locations, allowing flexibility and ease of usage in a variety of locations.
								In addition, the service can be edited utilising a coding language which is known by various team members, SQL.
								As a result, the service's usage is flexible as members will be able to manipulate the system around our needs and desires.
							</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Roles</h3>
						<h4 class="gurei">Project Manager (Michael)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Michael takes charge as Project Manager due to his experience leading in previous group projects.
							In his role, Michael is responsible for coordinating the efforts of the group, running group meetings, and considering the requirements of the application.
							Michael’s role required that he stay in constant contact with all members to ensure that everyone was working towards the same intended outcome. He also assisted, like many members, with the process of writing all relevant information into the group document.
							Michael was most in contact with Ricky and Collin, as their work acted as an extension of his, and Tomoki, due to how integral his work was to the final product.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Project Drafter (Ricky)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Ricky’s role of Project Drafter came about due to the amount of understanding that he showed in the initial concept, and his ability to apply the functions to real world situations.
							Ricky’s role entailed that he come up with a plan of how the application would function for other members to base their work off of.
							As an extension of this, he was in close contact with Michael, to know what the design needed to contain, and with Tomoki, to ensure that all that he had designed was present in the wireframes.
							Ricky was also in close contact with Collin to ensure that their parts of the plan melded together well. Alongside his main role, Ricky also helped with programming the website, and contributing written content to the group document.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Lead Developer (Tomoki)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Tomoki’s in-depth knowledge of programming leads him to take the role of Lead Developer.
							He was tasked with creating both a working wireframe for the application, using Figma as a baseplate, and a website for the research conducted, and group information to be stored.
							Tomoki’s role required him to keep in contact with many other members of the group, to ensure that what he was creating matched what was intended.
							These people who Tomoki was in contact with include; Michael for the requirements of the application and website, Ricky for assistance with the website and comparing what parts of his plan had been implemented, and Collin to ensure that the created application matched the concepts.
							Tomoki also contacted Domenic rather frequently to ensure that the database and application matched each other appropriately.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Chief  Editor (Thorpe)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Thorpe’s English skill led him to be a perfect fit as the Chief Editor. In his role, Thorpe took charge in reading over all writing within the project, including the application, website and group document.
							This required thousands of words worth of reading, and many rewritten sections to ensure consistency and quality.
							While he wasn’t editing the writing within the document, Thorpe was adding to it, ensuring that the document was as complete as he could.
							Thorpe’s role required him to keep in contact with a few other members consistently, such as Michael and Ricky, who took charge in completing substantial writing alongside their main roles.
							Thorpe also kept in contact with Felix and used his research as the basis as to how correct the information within the group document was.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Concept Designer (Collin)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Collin’s understanding of basketball, and the people involved in it allow him to make for the best Concept Designer.
							His role requires that he plans out the aesthetic, and locations of particular functions, in the applications.
							Collin is most qualified to do this as he comes from a basketball background, and as such knows what functions are optimal while together, and what styles appeal to the target audience best.
							Because of his role, Collin was in close contact with Ricky, to ensure their separate parts of the design melded together well, and Tomoki, to ensure that his design was present in the wireframes.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Lead Researcher (Felix)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Felix took the role of Lead Researcher and spent most of the time looking into the technologies that would allow the concept to be further expanded.
							Due to this, he spent quite some time looking into the Internet of Things, with a key focus on tracking.
							Felix kept in touch with Thorpe the most, to ensure that the writing done between the two of them was well written and was factually accurate.
							Felix also kept in contact with Michael and Ricky, as they both required the most research for each of their roles.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Database Administrator (Domenic)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Domenic’s knowledge of SQL and SQLite allowed him to take the forefront of the database aspect of the project as Database Administrator.
							For this role, Domenic created and maintained a database for the storage and use of all basketball data that the application required.
							This role was done rather separately compared to the other members of the group, although Domenic had reasons to keep in contact with some members of the group.
							Domenic kept most connected with Tomoki, to ensure that there was consistency in the basketball data used between both the application and the database, and Michael to make sure that the data present was what was intended.
						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Scope and Limits</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							The scope of the project given the time frame of four weeks, are: the completion of the initial stage of research in each member’s grouped field of research, development of the three artifacts,
							which would be, a figma which would have the framework design of the HoopStats™ application, an SQL database, to show the storage of a trial database of possible statistics of the users and learning how to link an API to our technology.
							<br><br>
							The limitations of the project are predominantly the restraints of time and funding.
							The group believes completion of the actual application is not feasible given the time constraint, especially with the increased design of the project from the second assignment.
							In addition to this, funding for the development of the technologies required for the project were not available.
						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Tools and Technologies</h3>
						<h4 class="gurei">Figma wireframes (create mock GUI and application)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							For the development of the application interface and prototyping, we utilised web-based online UI/UX designer Figma.
							Figma is a strong web application capable of designing interfaces for mobile applications such as our own, and implementing/integrating functionality into elements.
							Core features designed by this software include the HoopStats™ mobile application itself, in addition to its multitude of features including the interactive drills page, social media feed and its performance tracker.
							<br><br>
							Utilising features in figma, the team were able to create a working prototype of the desired mobile application with designed pages and operational interactive elements allowing users to actively switch between each of the pages on demand.
							Figma helps us envision our ideal mobile application in both appearance and functionality wise if we were to actually create the program.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Database SQL (database)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							To design and effectively integrate data into a database system, team Spurs utilised programming code SQL to manipulate and map table schemas and implement relevant data.
							Creating and testing the code, the team utilised software program SQLite in process test trials for the code, to ensure the functionality of the code and identify potential limitations.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">Player tracking/tracing algorithms</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Through extensive research of current day player tracking/tracing capabilities, we have come across many existing programs and algorithms capable of doing so.
							Some prime examples are that of machine learning algorithms, by learning and saving data on identifying features, such that items can be recognised later on.
							Examples of this include Autostats which utilise a machine learning algorithm in order to track players movement within a live match via their jersey and the corresponding number.
							Data collected from the cameras/sensors can be used to identify the movement and performance of an individual player.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">IoT sensors (tracking specific inputs)</h4>
						<p class="gurei">
							Taking inspiration from existing products such that of the HUAWEI Band 4e, certain sensors can reside within the form of an equippable accessory such as an armband,
							wristwatch or an attachable item on your shoe.
						</p>
						<h3 class="gurei">Testing</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							Through the processing of the design for the project, relevant testing will be required to ensure quality for the product's final version. Relevant testing data can be utilised to identify weak elements in the system, in order to improve the applications.
							This includes aspects such as interface and/or operation of the program.
						</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">[Computational testing]</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								Software/program majority of the time can be troublesome and tedious to create and troubleshoot this will require many instances of trial and error in order to achieve our desired outcome.
								Essential testing within our systems includes the SQL DDL language code required in both creating and manipulating the data within a data server,
								algorithms to transform the data into our desired format(averages and sums), code to program the IoT sensors and many other computational tasks.
								<br><br>
								Testing and troubleshooting of a system's internal processes is essential to ensure that everything operates smoothly, and to prevent potential errors in the future.
								Stress testing can be performed to assess the program's outer boundaries to identify constraints in the program and debugging can be performed on code to ensure that it produces the intended results.
							</p>
						<h4 class="gurei">[User testing]</h4>
							<p class="gurei">
								When conducting tests on the usability and likeability of our product, we require participants of our desired demographic to try and trial the application to ensure its feasibility within the live market.
								Gathering participants, various methods can be used include online advertisements such as social media and/or flyers on posting boards.
								For more of an incentive to persuade an individual to participate, they will be compensated for their time with a $10 shopping gift card.
								Ideally, the team would like to isolate individuals into groups and select them based on their characteristics. E.g., the team would be able to target basketball enthusiasts and/or players with basketball knowledge.
								However, due to limiting constraints, the most probable option would be convenience sampling, gaining as many participants despite their individual attributes.
								<br><br>
								User testing can be conducted on-site in a specified location, allowing for the experimental testing of the product during its developing/final stages under direct supervision and guidance from the researcher.
								Within an on-site scenario, participants will be individually consulted on the use-case for the application, testing usability and accessibility of items and elements.
								Additional methodology includes remote user-testing.
								Such testing methods can be utilised in the event where participants are unable to arrive on site for a session, they will complete the application trial off-campus, and perhaps online via video call to conduct the research.

						<h3 class="gurei">Risks</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							Projects and inventions are without doubt a difficult feat to create and achieve. This is due to the sheer amount of work and persistence required to maintain resilience throughout the painstaking design processes and tedious troubleshooting all in hopes to achieve an ideal outcome. In regards to HoopStats™, when designing and maintaining an application of this caliber, there arises the potential for numerous risks and scenarios which may prove detrimental to the project. 
							<br><br>
							Potential risks are constraints and concerns which may hinder our ability to pursue and/or produce our desired outcome, such that the assignment may not be completed by the required deadline. Risks include lack of knowledge on code utilised, reliance on existing services and products and machine/computer errors.
							<br><br>
							The nature of database management requires knowledge of the fundamental languages utilised in order to manipulate and store data, in tabular formats, so code must be written in proper formats to ensure the operation of the program. Computing errors are a potential risk towards our project as we are all fairly new with SQL database formatting language, and as a result, the creation of a database may pose difficulties with code that may be failing to execute.
							<br><br>
							Without the database for our basketball application, the program will be unable to collect, store and manipulate the data making the core functionality of the application no longer viable. Additionally, we may be reliant on public domain and cloud servers meaning that our storage functionality will be at their mercy. In the event that the cloud service shuts down, our application will be unable to function anymore, leaving the application disconnected from the data for as long as the cloud service is.
							<br><br>
							Furthermore, damaged/dysfunctioning technology will also prove detrimental towards the completion of our method of performance tracking that is dependent on IoT sensors and AI learning algorithms. In the project, sensors we’ll be using/manipulating are cameras and wristbands/armbands. Given the following crisis, technologies ceased to function, our player and performance tracking capabilities will no longer be possible thus making the applications core functionality obsolete.
						</p>
					
						<h3 class="gurei">Group processes and communications</h3>
						<p class="gurei">
							Our group ‘SPURS’ was successful in agreeing on an expected frequency of meetings and the use of multiple technologies in order to stay in frequent communication.
							We agreed that a minimum of two formal meetings per week is required of each group member to attend which will be documented and recorded on Microsoft Teams.
							Through the development process group members have been active in meetings with most members showing up consistently.
							On top of these formal meetings, impromptu or planned meetings also take place on Discord 1-2 times per week in which group work is discussed further and anyone who is unclear on the current work to be done is brought up to speed.
							Face-to-face meetings happen once per week during class on a Monday which are often missing a few group members; however our use of Discord and Microsoft Teams gives the feeling of constant and effective communication.
							If group members are unresponsive they are pinged on the group Discord which is generally effective and if they are unable to attend a meeting a reason for absence is given. In the event that a group member is completely unresponsive,
							meetings continue as planned and the work needing to be done is generally completed without a hitch.
							With such a large group, when someone misses out on something, other group members are able to pick up the slack and inform the unresponsive group member of the situation and what needs to be done when they are ultimately contacted.

						<h3 class="gurei">Group response</h3>
						<p class='gurei'>
							The group came in agreement that, while not as messy as last assignment, the group work could have been improved thoroughly. 
							Last project, the group agreed that the two key issues we faced were time management and communication. 
							This came about due to the group spending the first two weeks of assignment 2 completing virtually no work, and had a few bouts of lacking work, lasting days at a time in each. 
							The group had also communicated very little of what work had been completed, and who was working on what. 
							This led to assignment 2 feeling like we were all working separately at times.
							<br><br>
							For this assignment, team SPURS decided that we would put in effort to eliminate these flaws, to lead to a better working environment, and a better final document. 
							While the intention was that we would start work from the first week of the assignment, we fell back upon the old habit of procrastinating, although not for as long as last time, as we managed to make noticeable progress within the second week. 
							<br><br>
							Similarly, we aimed to improve our communication within this assignment. 
							This is something that we accomplished, as we managed to stay in almost daily contact with each other, and always knew what work each member was tasked with. 
							One way that we failed in this was that we weren’t consistent with group meetings. While we were always communicating, this was mostly via messages, and so we failed to have any formality to our communications.
							<br><br>
							This time around, we managed to delegate work much more effectively than the last assignment, as previously it was very noticeable which members of the team ensured that we finished any work at all. 
							This time around, larger tasks such as creating the Figma prototype, SQL database and major writing sections were given to members much more evenly, and as such, the team felt a lot more active.
							<br><br>
							To summarise, while the issues that the group noticed were present within assignment 2, were still present within this assignment, there were noticeable improvements. 
							The group managed to stay much more in contact this time around, and the work was started at a more appropriate time than before.

									Through the process of developing our project and communicating with group members there were some positive and negative aspects.
									We were able to communicate efficiently via discord and meet face to face during the Monday tutorials.
									After allocating the work to be done among the group members were good at keeping on the timeline and finishing their sections off.
									We had some difficulties with getting the project started, procrastinating the early portion of project time however we were able to come together and figure out time-efficient solutions to render the project complete.
									Our number of meetings might not have been as consistent as in previous group assignments however via other means of communication we were able to communicate effectively.
									<br><br>
									Michael was a great help to the group assisting in dividing the workload and keeping everyone on schedule as well as completing his parts to a high standard.
									Tomoki and Ricky were instrumental in the overall progress of the project researching and developing the app, with Tomoki doing great work on the Figma application as well as his part of the writing.
									Domenic did a great job at building the SQL database for the backend of the app as well as working with others to implement it. Collin and I worked well together doing our parts of the project as we shared some joint work.
									Thorpe worked well alongside Ricky researching for the project and its technical facets.
									<br><br>
									Overall, we generally had good communication, and each enjoyed working together. We seemed to have some differences in skill sets but were able to put them all together in order to finish the project.

									Through the course of assignment 3 for introduction to information technology, I believe that team Spurs members were able to work together coherently and ultimately complete the tasks at hand in an organized manner.
									Similarly with assignment two, members were able to complete their assigned tasks during their allocated times allowing for smoother transitions between different sections of the tasks.
									Since the group members became more accustomed to one another after the previous assignment, group allocated work was able to be completed in a quicker and easier manner.
									<br><br>
									In regards to individual merits, Michael Lim took charge and assumed leadership again for assignment three, managing majority of the team meetings ensuring that each individual member maintained steady progress within for their work.
									Tomoki, lead designer for the application, I believe did an exceptional job on creating the application and it’s concept designs using his masterful skills and capabilities in Figma programming.
									Additionally, he deserves main credit towards his focus on html and css to ensure we have an aesthetic and operating website towards the end of the project.
									Thorpe languages capabilities were critical in ensuring our written documentation was for the most part correct, notifying us if there were any inconsistencies with our documents.
									Domenic, taking charge in our most undesirable topic SQL, took command in documenting database capabilities and ultimately designing a database of our own.
									Felix operated efficiently throughout the assignment, completing each assigned task in a swift manner aiding support to members which required it most.
									Importantly, Collin maintained a role in creation of the final project, ensuring that the idea followed within the steps of his initial motives and making sure that features implemented were consistent with the game of basketball.
									<br><br>
									Overall, I enjoyed working alongside my teammates for this project, as I have very much fun having various discussions with each of the members for the project.
									I am satisfied with the effort put forth by everyone and am happy with the final product.

									Overall, the experience working with team SPURS again was a pleasant one,
									no disagreements came about, and the assignment documentation is formal and well structured.
									I felt the time management of the group was worse this time around, due to unexpected events and poor time management the scheduling was not handled professionally.
									<br><br>
									The member input the most was Ricky, if not for him leading the group, I do not believe the group would have finished in time.
									Tomoki is the most technology proficient, his knowledge in coding and his input into the website and code are the reason the website completed so well.
									Thorpe’s language skills were the reason the writing quality in this assignment is in a clean formal structure; without him the assignment quality would have been much lower.
									Domenic’s upbeat personality kept the environment of the group interactions calm and enjoyable.
									His input made it so no disagreements happened, and the work could progress smoothly.
									Collin’s project idea was the selected project, his ideas expanded into what it is now,
									he is the reason why our group is together, and we are learning about the new technologies.
									Felix’s teamwork was a key factor in getting the project completed, he promptly finished any task given to him,
									aiding the rest of the group members whenever he had finished.
									<br><br>
									As this project’s conclusion arrives, I am very pleased with the work ethic of all team members.
									I am glad to call them my teammates.

									Working as a part of the team SPURS was a fun and productive experience.
									We were able to communicate and work as a team to complete the assignment in the given time frame and demonstrated strong collaboration skills.
									Many strategies that we used in the previous assignments were implemented in this project.
									These strategies included having frequent meetings, having both casual working meetings and official discussion meetings,
									allocating work for each team member to do beforehand, having structured work plans, as well as using the strengths that each of the team members have to our advantage
									(e.g. Domenic and Thorpe are proficient in SQL and were in charge of making the sample databases).
									<br><br>
									Felix Langham did a lot of research and contributed detailed information to the assignment, Michael used his great leadership skills to delegate work and keeping everyone accountable for work,
									Domenic and Thorpe did a fantastic job on the SQL databases, Tomoki used his strong skills with Figma to create the skeleton of the application, and Ricky did an astounding amount of research and writing as well as formatting the google doc.
									<br><br>
									Overall everyone contributed a large amount of work towards this project and using teamwork we were able to work efficiently and effectively to get this assignment done.

									I believe that our group was able to work just as well, if not more efficiently, during Assignment 3 as the group did in Assignment 2.
									Team SPURS was able to communicate more effectively and positions within the group were established more quickly than in Assignment 2.
									The initial problem that occured during Assignment 2 of having a low work rate did occur again, however it was not as long as Assignment 2, so the improvement was nice to see.
									<br><br>
									In terms of the group members, Michael was once again the perfect leader for the group, organising and helping to divide the work, and overall making the whole group more comfortable working in the group setting.
									Ricky continued to stay ahead of the group in terms of taking responsibility for a large amount of work, and he was great at finishing a lot of work in a given period of time.
									Tomoki used his knowledge of HTML, CSS and Figma to create the website and focus on creating the Figma artifact as well, and he has done a phenomenal job.
									Collin has greatly improved since Assignment 2, and he has been great at using his extensive knowledge and understanding of the project idea to ensure it gets completed.
									Felix was actively involved in researching the technology required for the project idea and helping out Collin as well.
									Thorpe was a tremendous help for all the group members, helping out anyone who needed it, as well as helping me with the database and also being the chief editor and proofreading everyone's work to ensure it is up to the required standard.
									<br><br>
									I am very happy with how the team worked together to complete Assignment 3. Each member took responsibility for the work they needed to complete and did so within the timeframe given and up to a high standard as well.
									The group also improved its communication, and everyone worked very well with each other.

									I believe that our team was able to proceed more efficiently than Assignment 2.
									Since each member knew who would have a response which job position, the work went smoothly.
									However, this time it was more difficult than last time because we had to research and summarise more detailed technologies.
									<br><br>
									Of the members of the group, Michael continued to organise the team as the leader of the team.
									 He always kept track of the movements of the entire team and organised us.
									  Ricky was the most diligent in the group.
										He took the response to a lot of work.
										Domenic has used his knowledge of SQL to develop project ideas for the better.
										Collin has worked harder than last time.
										He also used his expertise and extensive knowledge in the field of basketball to come up with various ideas.
										Felix actively researched the technology needed to realize the project idea and compiled the necessary materials.
										Thorpe worked with Felix to create the document while checking the quality of the entire document.
									<br><br>
									In conclusion, I am very pleased that we were able to work together as team members.
									Each member has responsibility for their task and was able to complete a high-quality project idea document within the deadline.

									I believe that team SPURS worked more effectively during assignment 3 than we did in assignment 2.
									While we initially faced the same problems, with very little work being done immediately, this time through we spent less time in this low work period, which only lasted one week.
									A major improvement between the two group assignments was that the group stayed in much closer contact with each other. This culminated in the workload being much more evenly distributed, and more consistent contributions.
									<br><br>
									To elaborate on the group members, Michael yet again helped acting as a group leader, hosting meetings and ensuring everyone was making progress to the same end goal.
									He also completed a lot of necessary writing tasks. Tomoki, focused most of his efforts into creating our Figma artifact, and the website, while the database artifact was created solely but Domenic.
									Both of these two also completed parts of the writing components as well. Collin, due to his knowledge of basketball, acted very well in providing the group with useful and viable features that our application could incompass,
									and Felix took charge in many of the researching aspects of the features that Collin suggested.
									Last, but not least, Ricky kept within what we expected based on assignment 2, and was consistently writing major areas of information, and completing his work before the rest of the team.
									<br><br>
									Overall I wholeheartedly feel that the group dynamic during assignment 3 was a massive improvement over that of assignment 2.
									The group improved its interconnectivity, and produced more consistent work.
									The workload was also improved as the group managed to delegate tasks more evenly between members.
