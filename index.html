										<h3 class="gurei">Felix Langham</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My name is Felix Langham, I graduated in 2018, my student number is 3885080, and my team name is ‘Spurs’. I was born in Australia but my whole family is English. My favourite hobbies include snowboarding and Djing and going to the gym. My experience with IT includes self-taught SSH, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I built myself a gaming PC and have hacked x-box’s and administrator controls on laptops. I enjoy tackling the many challenges that arise in coding, the puzzles to solve so that my python code runs properly or figuring out the correct CSS so that my website does what I want it to do. Furthermore, I am interested in learning how to program as it is a highly employable skill and can be applied to a wide variety of fields.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Over the course of the project the group stayed in constant communication and was able to complete assignment 2 with a standard of work. Our mistakes from assignment 1 were used as teaching tools to inform us of our weaknesses and focus on these areas to improve upon in order to complete the assignment effectively. The group worked well together with no arguments or great disagreements which resolved in a smooth workflow.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">My ideal job is one that is remote, is in programming or development and preferably high paying. The position I have found includes front end development work, likely web development, specifically using React, JavaScript, and TypeScript. For this position it is required that you have 6+ years of development experience, and are highly proficient in React, TypeScript and JavaScript. Currently, I have less than 1 years of development experience and am only slightly proficient in JavaScript. In addition, the job listing states that it is preferable to have some experience in .NET, Cloud, and eCommerce. All of which I have no experience in. In order to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for this job I am going to complete the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Supplementing this with personal projects and freelance work building up my experience whilst creating a portfolio using the aforementioned stack. Some examples of extracurricular activities I might undertake would be: creating apps, websites and doing online courses such as CS50. <br><br>
										In contrast with other members of my group my current career path differentiates in the sense that I am keen on working remote and in the field of front end web development however, there are some similarities with other group members in the way that they acquire skills through extra-curricular activities such as and building a personal portfolio of work as well as undergoing a bachelors of IT in order to gain the necessary qualifications for future employment.

										<h3 class="gurei">Ricky Yu Qi Yao</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Ricky Yu Qi (Ricky) Yao, I graduated from East Doncaster Secondary College in 2020 and am now a first-year university student undergoing study for the Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT University, my student number being s3896813. I am an Australian born 07/02/2003 in Melbourne, Victoria coming from an Asian (Chinese) background. I enjoy playing video games and listening to music, it was the interest in both which led to my prominent usage of the internet and my laptop which increased my bond and affinity towards electronic devices. I am interested in the field of IT technologies due to its increasing growth and stability in the job market, providing a stable transition from student to employee in the future. Up until my studies at RMIT university, I had not before delved into the world of IT that much in terms of coding and network, but I am eager to learn. For assignment two, I will be working together within the team ’Spurs’.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											Assignment 2 overall, I believe was completed in an organised and timely manner. All independent team members were able to complete their distributed components with ease, quickly and effectively under our timed constraints. Some minor errors occurred during the initial preparation, organisation and distribution of the workloads and possibly the lack of communication between the group. However despite these issues, we were ultimately able to complete the assignment to an acceptable degree.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											After my studies at RMIT, I plan to pursue a profession within the field of network engineering. Such skills required of a network engineer are knowledge of network domain and infrastructure, with abilities capable of diagnosing and troubleshooting errors within a network system, and skills in integrating network protocols and restraints. Qualifications and job skills required for this career are most similar to my teammate Thorpe Honeyman, this is as we are pursuing a similar career pathway exploring the field of networking. I believe that during my time spent at RMIT, I will acquire the adequate knowledge and capabilities within the field of networking and be able to pursue a career as a network engineer in the possible future. In the event that I would like to pursue a higher education in order to assume a higher position, I may return to RMIT to gain a masters to gain additional knowledge within my field.

										<h3 class="gurei">Michael Lim </h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Michael Lim, my student code is s3543066 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I am an Australian born Chinese, and a Fourth year university student studying a Bachelor of Mechanical engineering at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. I am fluent in English, and have basic knowledge of speaking mandarin and Japanese. My interests include all forms of pop culture, technology, weightlifting, and socialising. My interest in Information Technology started with playing video games, which I have played since primary school. During high school, I was able to take IT as an elective. I learnt the basics of programming, and made simple applications and games. I learnt that coding and designing programs was a fun creative output. My studies at RMIT have taught me many concepts in the field of engineering and how they applied to real world situations. I hope to continue my studies and graduate from RMIT.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											I believe for assignment 2 the group worked relatively well together, the group’s worth ethic was good, and each member properly and efficiently did their designated tasks. Work was properly delegated relatively evenly and was done prior to the due date with time to properly refine it and rectify any errors. For assignment 3, with some of the key areas of its documentation being the timeframe section and plan and progress section, a push to better the groups time management is put into place. This is intended to help the group better themselves, and give more time to allow refinement with our writing ability and work on the artifacts of the assignment.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											My current career path is to aim to be a mechanical engineer, preferably in the field of parts and materials design. The main programs of trade which I have learnt in my time at RMIT are AutoCad, Solid works and CATIA, these are engineering design programs that allow a user to design drawings and 3 dimensional models and can perform a digital stimulation of possible loads via a finite element analysis. As I am the only one of the projects following the field of engineering, my career path is quite different to my peers in which they are all following the field of IT. However, the field of design of technology is something which quite a few of the members of the group are following, alas be it the software design in comparison to hardware or materials design in my case. Upon graduation, I plan to get an internship at a mid to large size engineering firm or gain an entry level job such as engineering draftsman for experience for the time being. The intent to travel to another country to seek work has always been a thought process which I have had. My current huddles are graduating university, having experience and being financially capable of putting the plan into action.<br><br>
											Overall, my career path is quite like the rest of my groups, graduate university, find an entry level job or internship, then extend my career path henceforth. The area of study may be different but the path and how I intend to travel down it is relatively the same as the team's approach.

										<h3 class="gurei">Collin Ng</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hi! My name is Collin Ng (s3901105 - part of the SPURS group) and I’m in my first year of Bachelor of IT. I was born in Malaysia and when I was 4 years old my family migrated to Melbourne, which is where we’ve been living ever since. I graduated from Highvale Secondary College in 2020. I grew up in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne so my family and I are pretty westernised, and my siblings and I can only speak English, but we do still celebrate Asian cultural events like Chinese New Year.<br>
										<br>I’m super into basketball, skateboarding, playing video games (valorant got me cramming this assignment), working out in my backyard, and since Uni started, I’ve been really enjoying meeting new people and experiencing the Uni life. Recently I got my Ls, so I’ve been really getting into driving cars and car designs, especially the street car culture (JDM cars are so nice to look at).
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											Team spurs worked exceptionally well throughout our work on assignment 2. We demonstrated excellent teamwork, communication and delegation skills which resulted in us completing assignment 2 in time for the due date and to the best of our abilities. Our group had gotten comfortable since the first assignment and because of this we were able to work efficiently and effectively. We will carry over these same processes into this assignment. We are most comfortable with these methods and perform really well. In the future we may alter these processes slightly as we have to cater to new tasks and objectives that come up, for example when we start to develop our mobile application our process will change slightly to accommodate this task.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											As of right now I see my dream career in cybersecurity. This field of IT revolves around the necessity of protecting a company’s networks, systems, as well as the personal data of both employees and customers. This requires me to keep up with the up-and-coming technological advancements in order to survey how these advancements can be used by potential hackers or maybe even utilised to protect a company from threats. Through this understanding cybersecurity specialists will be in charge of implementing threat protection measures and security controls. I will not be able to become a cybersecurity specialist straight out of highschool, as this position requires years of experience and knowledge. So for the meanwhile taking up a lower level position within cybersecurity is necessary to gain this knowledge and experience.<br><br>
											Compared to the other members in my group, I share a pretty similar career pathway. This consists of completing studies at university, taking up a job related to their dream job in order to obtain experience, and then finally achieving the position of that dream job. For me though, I still have very little experience and knowledge about other fields in IT, so I think there is a good possibility my dream career will change.

										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello, my name is Domenic Sinni (s3900567 - part of the SPURS group) and I was born and raised in Melbourne and I am a first-year student after graduating from high school. I am studying Bachelor of Information Technology and I chose to complete my studies at RMIT for multiple reasons but mainly because of its reputation of being an excellent technology-based university and the location. I enjoy gaming, especially games like Call of Duty, NBA2K, Pokemon, Fortnite and Terraria. I also have a great passion for basketball and the NBA. I enjoy programming and while I only know the basics, I am trying to learn more and improve my skills in programming as I wish to be a programmer for my career.I have no real experience in the IT field, and so this course is going to help me get started in the field as I do wish to go further in this field.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											I personally believe that the group worked well together during Assessment 2, as while there were improvements that could be made to improve the work of the assessment, the group managed to get together and focus and get the work completed in a timely and efficient manner. The first few weeks of Assessment 2 were a slight struggle, as not much work was completed during this period of time, however after this minor error, the organisation and work rate improved significantly as well as the communication across the group. The group was able to complete the assignment on time and to an acceptable standard.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											I would like to work as a video game programmer and/or developer. The main abilities and qualities that are required for this kind of role would include communication, teamwork, problem solving, passion and creativity, and time management. The IT related skills that are required for this job would include knowledge of game engine such as Unity, knowledge of coding and programming languages such as C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML and CSS, as well as experience in making small projects like a mobile game. To be able to apply for this type of job, the qualifications that I need in order to pursue this course would include experience using game engines, at least 1-2 personal game projects on PC/Mobile, as well as a tertiary degree or an equivalent professional qualification in a relevant field. While I complete my university degree, I plan on creating my own little projects to gain more experience in the field that I wish to pursue, and after I have graduated I plan on applying for a job that is based around game programming or applying for an internship.<br><br>
											My career plan is not that dissimilar from the rest of the group, in the sense that each of us plan to complete a degree in a relevant field in order to be eligible for their respective career. My job is different from most of the group, except it does have some similarities to Tomoki’s plan, as it involves improving programming skills. Game programming is a far different career from a career like Network Engineering for example, and so my plan is different from Ricky and Thorpe’s career plans.

										<h3 class="gurei">Sakamoto Tomoki</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">Hello. My name is Sakamoto Tomoki, my student code is s3821551 and my project’s group’s name is SPURS. I graduated from the National Institute of Technology, Kagoshima College in Japan after studying electrical and electronic engineering for 5 years. I was shocked by the high level of graduate students other than myself at the internship I did when I was in the 4th grade, and decided to go abroad (internship students other than myself are graduate students). I used to have a dog when I was in Japan, but since I came to Australia I have had four cats. And also mate cats and sell kittens. So far, I figured out buyers for kittens and sold 11 kittens.<br>
										<br>
										After studying as one of the college classes, my interest in IT began. The site I created after graduating from college gets over 300,000 PV every month and is profitable by affiliates and Google Adsense. For example, in an article I wrote about Nintendo Switch's new game "Monster Hunter" last month, it was accessed by nearly 5,000 people every day. Therefore, last month's sales $ 10,000 on Amazon. it's only the controller.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											In assignment 2, the work did not proceed easily during the first few weeks because we did not know each other very much, however after Micky managed to organise the team well, our group cooperated and efficiently shared the work. In assignment 3, we will make use of our previous reflections to try to communicate with each other and take care not to delay the work. In addition, unlike the last time, the roles are divided by making the best use of each other's areas of expertise, so we are functioning well toward achieving the tasks.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											I am planning to work as a software engineer in the future. After graduating from RMIT, I will return to Japan and work, but I would like to get a job at an overseas company that has expanded into Japan in recent years. Therefore, I would like to get some experience working together with people of different nationalities during my study abroad period. This Assessment is also very interesting to me. Working together as a team to perform a single task is very similar to a real working environment. I had experience enrolled in a Japanese university, but they did not have this kind of assignment. And improving my programming skills, I believe the RMIT uni has an environment to hone my coding skill. The field of machine learning using Python, which I am currently studying in other courses, is a field that has been delayed in development in Japan, so I think it will definitely be useful when I return to Japan. In addition, I am developing a smartphone app using Flutter for myself. I plan on releasing it in August, and I think this process will probably be useful for my career. Based on group work in these English environments, machine learning with Python, and individual development experience, when I go back to Japan, I want to succeed with my job.<br><br>
											My group members seem to be planning to get a job in Australia, so my career plan is very different from other group members, but I think it's similar to Domenic in improving programming skills.

										<h3 class="gurei">Thorpe Honeyman</h3>
										<h4 class="gurei">Personal Information Summary</h4>
										<p class="gurei">I am Thorpe Honeyman, student number s3897395, of team SPURS. I am a first year student at RMIT, studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. I was born to an english family in Crewe, England, and lived near there until I was four and a half, when I moved to Australia. I have previously studied IT as a VET course at Ringwood Training, during high school at Mullauna College.  In my free time I attend scouting groups, both as a rover, and as a trainee cubs leader. For cubs I attend weekly meetings where I help teach the cubs camping skills and run games. I also sometimes attend cubs camps where I help lead groups of cubs to activities, and ensure that they stay safe. When I’m not scouting I am usually playing video games, mainly roguelikes such as Enter the Gungeon and The Binding of Isaac. I have been interested in IT since my high school allowed me to do it as an elective, and I have had a continual interest, mainly in building computers and linking them into networks.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Group Processes</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											The group worked well together for assignment 2, although there were quite a few improvements that could have been made. The initial few weeks for assignment 2 were mostly unused, and it took some time before the group really got into the motion of the project. Another difficulty was that the group wasn’t very good at communicating with each other, both in the work they had done, and their future availability. To fix these issues, we will aim to talk more consistently, and start the project at an earlier date.
										</p>
										<h4 class="gurei">Career Plans</h4>
										<p class="gurei">
											I intend upon becoming a network administrator, or possibly network engineer, after completing this Bachelor of Information Technology. To achieve this I will require a Bachelor level degree in IT, which is very achievable as that is what I am already studying. I Would benefit from further study into networking, like the Certificate III in Networking that I have achieved. My career requires very common work skills, such as time-management, team-working and problem-solving, but also requires skills unique to networking. These skills include an understanding of network parts, wiring types and troubleshooting techniques. For a higher level job as network administrator, it would be important that I have at least some level of experience within a networking or general IT environment, so working as a technical support initially could help that be achieved. <br>
											Within the group, my career is most similar to Ricky Yu Qi Yao’s, as we are both interested in pursuing networking. My career is also similar to the remainder of the group, as we are all, apart from Michael, interested in IT.

Each individual aims to explore a different aspect of the IT world in their future occupations such as a front end developer, cybersecurity analyst, video game programmer/developer, network administrator, and software and network engineer.<br>
							<br>
							Some noticeable similarities within the ideal jobs includes the software engineer and video game programmer/developer, which are both programming heavy jobs, require a strong understanding of programming languages and scripts, which include Java, JavaScript, C#, Python and others. Other similarities can be found within the Network field jobs (Network Administrator & Network Engineer), as both are based in the same field, they require similar skills such as being able to create and configure networks, and network diagnosis and repair. In contrast, we have a senior in course studying Mechanical Engineering, who thus has an outlier in preferred occupation, as his job is more in the engineering field than in information technology. <br>
							<br>
							Almost all the ideal jobs chosen by the team members are high paying jobs, paying above AU$70,000 p.a. The main outlier would be Domenic’s chosen job, Video Game Programmer  job has the lowest annual average salary of AU$56,348 p.a, while the highest paying role is a Software Engineer, chosen by Tomoki with the annual average salary of AU$78,509 p.a.

						<h2>Group Reflections</h2>
						<p class='mojii'>
							Analysis on assignment performance in regards to <br>
							progression, contribution and efficiency.
						</p>
						<h3>Collective Reflection</h3>
						<p class='mojii'>
							With the completion of this assignment, it has come to our attention that, overall, the group worked relatively well together. This being a first year first semester course, for most of the members in the group this would have been their first major assignment. Which forces them into the situation of working together with many people they are unfamiliar with.
							<br>
							<br>
							The main positives of team SPURS were that the quality of work produced was deemed satisfactory by the group, though there were many aspects of the project that could have been better performed. In particular in the IT work section, it would have been beneficial for the group to have done an interview with an IT professional instead of just referencing ten articles, as it would have introduced us to a real professional and it would have given us experience with interacting in a work environment. When it came time to divide the workload and split the members into mini groups, the teamwork and input of most members was relatively evenly distributed. There were of course some members who went above and beyond, putting in more input into this project than others. Though not always productive, it was discovered that the group could work at a quick and efficient pace when properly motivated. Whenever a group member had trouble with collecting research or completing their section of the assignment, other members would help them understand the possible problem and resolve the misunderstanding. One of the major positives of our group was that the group would consistently hold the two Microsoft Teams meetings per week requirement, with an average participation with most of the group members. Though the discussion was not always relevant, the environment in the meetings was very approachable and the group did not have any major disagreements.
							<br>
							<br>
							The main negatives of team SPURS were that our time management skills were quite poor, even with having consistent meetings and a proper timeline to schedule the project’s completion, the group would consistently not complete work by the initial deadline. Whilst, not with all members there was a lack of communication with some of the members, not attending the group meetings or even not contacting the group for days at a time. Lastly, most probably the largest negative of working with the group would have been a complete lack of productivity during the initial first two weeks of the assignment, had the group worked properly and productively the work quality would have most likely been much higher given the larger time constraint.

									Working with my team ‘Spurs’ has overall been an enjoyable experience with group members being engaged and happy to participate. Each member got their work done in an efficient manner and each had good input.
									<br>
									<br>
									The quality of the work of the group and the pace at which it was completed were some things the group flourished in. Furthermore, the participation in group meetings on ‘Microsoft Teams’ as well as in class was very good with most of the group members showing up consistently. There were some issues with getting work done by certain dates and communicating however, it all came together in the end. I learned that communication is very important and is something that could be improved upon.
									<br>
									<br>
									Collin’s ongoing input on the group project was very helpful as it was his idea. Ricky showed great leadership qualities, taking charge of group organisation which was very effective. Tomoki’s skills in coding were well utilized when building the website, creating an efficient and aesthetic design. Domenic and Thorpe were good at giving insightful advice on sticking points in the project as well as Michael who was effective at completing work and giving insightful input.
									The GitHub activity does not accurately reflect the groups involvement as group members were working on different aspects of the assignment throughout, and the website was only made at the end.

									The group assignment ‘Team Project’ was completed with speed and efficiency, though the initial start-up was less than ideal, we eventually got a good grasp on how we would complete our tasks and cooperated with ease until the project was completed.
									Regarding the project, there could have been better communication between the team members as task prioritization and time management were lacking with long periods of time where we did not know which area had to be completed.
									<br>
									<br>
									In terms of teammates, I found all members of team Spurs to be quite good. Michael presented great leadership skills in the forefront of the project, organising and speaking in the majority of the teams’ meetings. Thorpe previewed excellent English capabilities and quality checked a lot of our work, in addition to great flexibility providing help to members and overall staying on top of the project. Tomoki shows exceptional skills in website formatting, leading head in the battle of formatting the final website. Domenic and Collin utilised their expertise and extensive knowledge in the field of Basketball to further implement features into the ‘hoop stats’ idea. Felix showed innovation proposing many suggestions during the write up of project documents.
									<br>
									<br>
									Github was not an accurate representation of our contribution as we utilised google docs to complete and track the progress of our tasks.

									Overall, the experience working with team SPURS was a pleasant one, no disagreements came about, and the assignment documentation is formal and well structured. I felt the time management of the group was somewhat poor, I hope that next time the group follows the designed project timeline.
									<br>
									<br>
									The member inputted the most was Ricky, if not for him leading the group, I do not believe the group would have finished in time. Tomoki is the most technology proficient, his knowledge in coding and his input into the website and code are the reason the website completed so well. Thorpe’s language skills were the reason the writing quality in this assignment is in a clean formal structure; without him the assignment quality would have been much lower. Domenic’s upbeat personality kept the environment of the group interactions calm and enjoyable. His input made it so no disagreements happened, and the work could progress smoothly. Collin’s project idea was the selected project, his ideas expanded into what it is now, he is the reason why our group is together and we are learning about the new technologies. Felix’s teamwork was a key factor in getting the project completed, he promptly finished any task given to him, aiding the rest of the group members whenever he had finished.
									<br>
									<br>
									As the website was not the main priority, the group did not work on the GitHub repository until the end of the assignment thus, I do not believe the GitHub logs represent the groups work quality.

									Since introducing myself to the group ‘Spurs’ and getting to know all its members, we have worked as a group exceedingly well. As with all newly formed groups starting to really work together and engaging in team work was slow at first and we could feel it as dates for assignments started getting closer. But once we had gotten comfortable with and started to better understand each other we started pumping out some really good work that we put a lot of effort into.
									<br>
									<br>
									At the head of the group is Micheal, from the beginning he stepped up and was willing to take responsibility as team leader. Great communication and delegating skills, allowing the rest of the group to work with each other more efficiently. Ricky was one of the most hardworking of the group, always being ahead of the work the group was up to in order to set it up for us. He really pushed himself and was willing to do work that had not even been allocated to each group member. Domenic was extremely helpful, especially when it came to our project idea as he was able to share extensive knowledge and experience playing and refereeing basketball with the rest of the group. Felic would give amazing input in group meetings, and always had a positive attitude whilst discussing and recommending new ideas. Tomoki and Thorpe both passed around some really good ideas and proposals, and would always have something insightful to offer to the team. They had outstanding teamwork skills that the group very much appreciated.
									<br>
									<br>
									We as a team decided that using a shared google doc to store the information and other necessary details would be more effective and decided to make the website after all the work was done. This means the GitHub logs will not show the real group activity.

									The experience I’ve had with working with team ‘Spurs’ has been an enjoyable one, as I have had fun working with and getting to know everyone in the group. I felt that time management is the major area that the group needs to work on in the future as the first couple of weeks after the assignment was given the work management and output wasn’t there. However, I was proud of the group's ability to produce work after that point.
									<br>
									<br>
									Of the members of the group, Michael was brilliant at being the leader, getting everyone focused on what was needed to get the work done, as well as being the chair in meetings. Collin had a great understanding of the project idea and his input around the idea was fantastic. Felix and Tomoki were both excellent at setting their minds on the goal at hand and getting all the work done to contribute to the team in a great way. Thorpe was great at pacing the group and helping out myself and anyone else who needed it, as well as improving the overall quality of the assessment. Ricky was the person who I believe stood out, as he managed to stay ahead of the rest of us in terms of work production and was always helping out and lending a hand to others within the group.
									<br>
									<br>
									The GitHub logs don’t accurately reflect the group activity, as the majority of group members focused on completing the actual work rather than the coding side. The log will show that most work was completed later in the time frame, but in actuality the website was completed later than the rest of the assessment.

									Our team strived for the work everyone has been assigned devoted to. We had meetings using the team twice a week, in addition, we had done extra meetings on Discord to check and support each other's progress. Overall, we were able to cooperate until the project was completed.
									<br>
									<br>
									-Michael managed the work progress of the project as a team leader. I believe that project has been completed by his excellent communication skills.
									<br>
									-Ricky has done any work on the project while assisting each member as a sub-leader. It is his credit that the project went according to plan.
									<br>
									-Domenic was the indispensable man to complete this project idea. The project idea eventually became better by his idea.
									<br>
									-Collin's idea is the origin of this project idea, his unique way of thinking was very useful.
									<br>
									-Felix was most responsible for his task. He often gave great opinions at meetings.
									<br>
									-Thorpe has checked a look at the whole project and has devoted itself to improving quality. The high quality of this project will show his high ability.
									<br>
									<br>
									Finally, the website was created last because we prioritised the completion of the content, but since it was basically created in an offline environment, the GitHub log does not accurately represent it.

									While our initial few weeks were less than perfect, I believe team SPURS worked well on this assignment. To improve on our assignment, we could have used better time management, as we completed very little work in the first few weeks and had periods of unanimous lack of work. I was surprised by how much work we were able to accomplish in such a short period of time after our initial bumpy start, which gave us less than a month to complete everything.
									<br>
									<br>
									Of the group members, I found that Michael was very good at coordinating the group and acting a chair for our meetings, Domenic and Collin had very good knowledge of the logistics of the project idea, Tomoki and Felix were very good at cracking down on lots of work at a time, and Ricky was very well organised, and consistently ahead of the group. I learnt that for group projects, communication is paramount, as we tended to struggle more when not communicating what we had completed.
									<br>
									<br>
									I don’t believe that the GitHub logs accurately represent our group activity, as many group members, focused purely on the writing rather than coding. The log also shows that work was mostly completed late in the project, when the truth is that the website was completed later than the rest.
